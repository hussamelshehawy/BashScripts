## bash_scripts
**These are some bash scripts I wrote during the preparation for my RHCSA.**
List Of Scripts:
1. Find a file in /etc/ directory with size greater than 5M and copy it to home directory
2. System Information + Logged in users + Hostname 
3. A script that looks for sysinfo.sh and if found executes it, else it runs the hostname command
4. Basic input/output scripts
